            <p>
                My personal and professional growth have been shaped by my experiences living across three
                continents. Through these experiences I have been able to broaden my understanding of diverse
                cultures and the emotional complexities of life. Asia played an influential during my formative years,
                and Africa provided me the opportunity to pursue a degree in psychology, sparking my enthusiasm for
                the field of therapy. After moving to the United States, I earned additional graduate degrees and
                became licensed as a professional counselor (LPC) and addictions counselor (LCADC). My diverse
                experiences enable me to provide holistic therapeutic services to individuals from all walks of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before becoming a mental health therapist, I worked in the marketing industry. 
                This experience taught me how societal and cultural expectations can significantly impact mental health. 
                The pressure to conform to physical or emotional standards of beauty, can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. 
                Such feelings in turn, can contribute to the development of anxiety, depression, body image struggles, and even undiagnosed trauma.
            </p>
            <p>
                My path to becoming a mental health therapist involved my personal journey. The experiences and challenges faced in my formative years resulted in a scarred childhood which led to three things.
