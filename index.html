            <h2>An Integrative Approach to Treatment</h2>  
            <p>My therapeutic approach is centered on enhancing your physical, emotional, social, and spiritual wellness. 
            Every case is unique and requires a personalized approach. By utilizing an integrative method that draws on a range of techniques, I create a customized plan tailored to your specific requirements. 
            If you value the therapeutic alliance as a collaborative partnership and desire an active role in your recovery, a holistic or integrative approach may prove beneficial for you.</p>
            <p>Apart from employing talk therapy techniques, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), I incorporate innovative therapeutic approaches, such as Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing (EMDR), 
            Internal Family Systems (IFS), Psychodynamic approach, and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), to gain deeper insights into the root cause of your concerns and assist you in attaining your objectives</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>As an immigrant, I have a deep affection for three continents that have shaped my life in different ways. Asia played a vital role in my formative years, while Africa offered the opportunity to pursue a master's degree in psychology and begin my journey as a therapist. Eventually, I moved to the United States, where I earned another graduate degree and continue to practice as a therapist. My professional credentials include dual licenses as a licensed professional counselor (LPC) and a licensed clinical alcohol and drug counselor (LCADC).</p>
            <p>Before I became a therapist, I worked in marketing in the beauty industry, I came to understand how societal and cultural expectations can profoundly affect mental health. The push to conform to standards of beauty, whether physical or emotional, can create a sense of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Such feelings, in turn, may contribute to the development of anxiety, depression, body image struggles, and even undiagnosed trauma.</p>
            <p>My aim is to assist you in achieving change in your life. By providing guidance and support, I hope to empower you to lead a productive life and develop coping mechanisms for ongoing struggles, pain, and relational issues. My ultimate goal is to help you achieve your goals and make a positive impact to your life.</p>
